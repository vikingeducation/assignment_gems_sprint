[Trevor Elwell](http://trevorelwell.me) gems sprint assignment.

# Introduction
This is an incredibly simple gem which allows you to play the game rock, paper, scissors from the CLI. It's not the best game in the world but hey, Rome wasn't built in a day.

# How to use
Once you've required the gem, simply create a new RockPaperScissors object: 

`example = RockPaperScissors.new`

You'll see the object's information show up below it. Once you're ready, simply call the 'start' method on your new object to play! 

`example.start`

Hope you enjoy, please feel free to email me if you have any questions.
